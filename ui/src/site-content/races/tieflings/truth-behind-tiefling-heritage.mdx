title: The Truth Behind Tiefling Heritage
---
Contrary to popular belief, it is not always the case that tiefling heritage can be traced back to fiendish dealings. It is not uncommon for tieflings to appear spontaneously, without any discernible lineage.

As evidence, I present the case of the renowned sorcerer, Tharion the Enchanter. Despite extensive research and investigation, no trace of fiendish blood or influence could be found in either of Tharion's parents. However, upon administering the Fiendish Ancestry Test, Tharion's results were undeniable - he possessed inherent fiendish powers.

It is clear from this example that tiefling heritage cannot be solely determined by lineage. The appearance of tieflings may also be attributed to spontaneous occurrences, as evidenced by Tharion's case.
