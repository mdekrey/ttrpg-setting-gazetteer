# The Harvest Revolt

The "Harvest Revolt" was a peasant uprising that took place 10 years ago within the kingdom of Albion. The rebellion was led by a charismatic farmer named Thomas Reed, who rallied the common folk against the local governor, Lord Rupert Blackwood. The catalyst for the uprising was the governor's decision to raise taxes on the already struggling peasantry, coupled with the increasing price of food and poor harvests.

The rebellion was met with brutal retaliation by Lord Blackwood and his guards, which only fueled the anger of the commonfolk and led to more widespread riots and strikes. The situation quickly spiraled out of control, and the king of Albion was forced to send in military troops to quell the rebellion.

One of these troops was The Gryphons, a particularly ruthless military troupe led by Captain Marcus Grey. Leoric Armbruster, a young and ambitious soldier, quickly rose through the ranks of The Gryphons, using the brutal tactics that earned him his nickname "The Lash" to round up and flog entire towns and villages. This further enraged the rebellion and caused more to join them.

Despite the efforts of Thomas Reed and his followers, the rebellion was ultimately put down by the combined forces of The Gryphons and Lord Blackwood's guards. Many of the leaders of the rebellion were captured and executed, including Thomas Reed. The aftermath of the rebellion saw the rise of Leoric Armbruster to the rank of Captain, but he was eventually expelled from the military for reasons not disclosed to the public.
