Farcorner is a small hamlet located at the southwest corner of the country's territory, at the border of the West Weald. The people of Farcorner are mostly farmers and ranchers, who live off the land and are known for their hardworking and independent spirit. They are known to keep to themselves, but they are welcoming to outsiders.

The hamlet is composed of a small collection of houses and farms, with a population of around a few dozen people. The houses are built with mindful traditions and superstitions to not draw the ire of the Fey. The people of Farcorner are self-sufficient and rely heavily on their own resources to sustain themselves. They are known for their excellent farming and herding skills, and the high-quality of their produce, which is exceptional due to the latent magic from the nearby West Weald causing plants, especially trees, to grow exceptionally hearty. Their produce is known throughout Albion.

Farcorner is situated at the border of the West Weald, a neighboring forest, which is home to the fey. The hamlet is safe from any potential threats due to the treaty established between the fey and the kingdom of Albion. The main crops of Farcorner are grains and fruits, grown in fertile fields surrounding the hamlet, and the residents also keep a few livestock such as sheep, goats and cows.
