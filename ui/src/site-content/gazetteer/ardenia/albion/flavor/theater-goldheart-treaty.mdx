# Overheard from a street play...

(Scene opens with the signing of the treaty)

```
NARRATOR: And thus, the stage is set for history's play,
With quills in hands, and parchment on display.
The fey, with grace, and half-elves of Albion,
Come forth to sign this treaty, with a bond so strong.

ELWYNN GOLDHEART: Half-elves of Albion, we are proud to say,
We've struck a deal with the fairies of our way.
With this treaty, we secure our peace,
And with our kin, we'll never more decrease.

(The FEY LEADER steps forward, quill in hand)

FEY LEADER: And we, the fey, with joy in every heart,
Agree to this treaty, to do our part.
We'll honor it, and guard it, with our might,
And keep it safe, till the end of our sight.

(Both LEADERS sign the treaty with flourish)

NARRATOR: And so, the treaty was signed with grace,
A symbol of peace, in a world full of hate.
The half-elves and fey, lived in harmony,
And the treaty remains, for all posterity.

NARRATOR: The Goldheart Treaty still holds its sway,
A reminder of peace, on this bright new day.
For all to see, the power of love and care,
In a world that's dark, this light shines ever rare.
