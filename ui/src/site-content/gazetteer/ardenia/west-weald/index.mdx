The West Weald is a dense and mysterious forest that lies on the western border of the Kingdom of Albion. It is a wild, untamed land filled with ancient trees, winding streams, and hidden groves. The forest is home to all manner of creatures, from the timid deer to the ferocious bear. It is also home to many fey, creatures of magic and trickery, who dwell in the hidden glades and copses. The West Weald is a place of great beauty and danger, where one can easily get lost and never return.

One of the most peculiar features of the West Weald is that it is a place where the boundaries between the mortal realm and the Feywild are thin. Occasionally, fragments of the Feywild will be randomly teleported into the West Weald. These fragments can range from small, overgrown gardens to entire villages, complete with houses and inhabitants. These areas are known as "Feywild incursions" and are considered dangerous, as the laws of reality do not always apply within them. It is said that powerful magics are at work in the West Weald, bringing these incursions to the mortal realm, but the source of these magics remains a mystery.
