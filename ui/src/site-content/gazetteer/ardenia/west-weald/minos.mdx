# Minos

Minos is a village of minotaurs that once thrived in the Feywild. Once connected to other settlements via magical portals, Minos was suddenly teleported to the material plane, within the [West Weald](../), due to one of the "Feywild incursions" that the region has been experiencing. The village's portals were left broken and destroyed, with many runes missing.

The minotaurs have kept themselves hidden from the [Albion](../albion/)'s residents through the use of magic and stealth, but they have also sent out scouts in search of a way back to the Feywild. One of these scouts is Neala Fistbane, a fierce warrior and expert in conjuration magic, who poses as a mercenary to the people of Albion as one of the few people willing to brave the Weald.

The village of Minos is made up of sturdy stone buildings, built to withstand the harsh conditions of the West Weald. The village is led by their chieftain, Ulfgar Ironhoof, who is known for his wisdom and strength in battle. Another scout is Yara Stormchaser, who is known for her stealth and tracking skills. The minotaurs of Minos continue to search for a way back to the Feywild, but in the meantime, they make the best of their new home and do their best to survive in the West Weald.
