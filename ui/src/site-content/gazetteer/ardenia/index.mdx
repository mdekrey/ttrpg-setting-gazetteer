# Ardenia

The continent of Ardenia is a diverse land of rugged terrain and varied cultures. In the north lies the Sandscrape Desert, known for its vast expanses of scorching sands, and it is one of the most inhospitable regions in Ardenia. Despite this, the nomadic tribes of Sandrion have thrived here for centuries. These hardy people are skilled horseback riders and have mastered the art of survival in the desert. They also control the trade routes that cross the desert, making them a powerful force in the region.

The Blue Horizon, a massive inland sea located south of the desert, is a stark contrast to the harshness of the Sandscrape. It is home to a diverse array of marine life and is a major source of food and trade for the people of Ardenia. The sea's calm waters and mild climate make it a popular destination for fishing, boating, and trade.

The Verdant Spine, a majestic mountain range, runs across the continent just south of the Blue Horizon. These peaks are covered in lush green forests, and the wildlife that inhabits the range is said to have magical powers. The Verdant Spine is also known for its rich deposits of precious gems and metals, which have attracted prospectors and miners for centuries.

The eastern coast of Ardenia is home to the kingdom of Albion, a prosperous land known for its skilled artisans and powerful army. The western coast is home to the maritime nation of Isendria, known for its skilled sailors and powerful fleet. To the south, the tropical stretch of lush jungles and ancient ruins that were once the kingdom of Suncrest.

Ardenia is a continent of great diversity, with a rich tapestry of cultures, customs, and history. From the Sandscrape Desert in the north to the tropical jungles of the south, and from the powerful kingdom of Albion on the eastern coast to the maritime nation of Isendria on the western coast, Ardenia offers something for everyone.
