# Gaia

<ImagePreview image={worldImage} alt="A map of Gaia" />

The world of the material plane is known to its inhabitants as Gaia. One of the
known spheres of existence, Gaia is home to many races, most commonly humans,
elves, dwarves, halfings, and gnomes. Gaia is a temperate orb, generally
experiencing colder temperatures at the northern and southern pole, with
seasonal changes.

Gaia is a diverse and fascinating place, full of different cultures, races, and
landscapes. The four major continents are known as Ardenia, Eternia, Norgard,
and Solaria. Each continent is unique and home to a variety of different races
and cultures.

Ardenia is the largest continent, and is home to the majority of the human
population. It is known for its vast forests, rolling hills, and sprawling
cities. The elves and dwarves also have a strong presence in Ardenia, and the
continent is home to many powerful kingdoms and empires.

Eternia is a land of rugged mountains and long, cold winters. It is a harsh
environment, but the dwarves have built thriving cities deep within the
mountains, and the gnomes have adapted to the cold with their advanced
technology.

Norgard is a land of fjords and glaciers, where the halflings and other races
such as gnomes have made their homes. The halflings are known for their
seafaring skills and have established a strong maritime culture.

Solaria is a land of lush jungles and rugged mountains, where the elves and
other races have made their homes. The elves are known for their ancient wisdom
and powerful magic.

Off the coast of Ardenia lies the island chain of Eldrida, a group of lush
tropical islands, home to a seafaring civilization composed of mix of human,
halfling, and gnomes, known for their skilled navigators and sailors. This
culture has established trade routes between the continents, and their merchants
are known for the exotic goods they bring from all over the world.
