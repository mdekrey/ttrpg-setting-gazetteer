_"Micrometers from where you now stand, in a direction you cannot comprehend, exist planes of existance beyond your imagination. The Shadowfell. The Ethereal Plane. Elemental Planes of only Air. Or of only Fire. But beyond those are the realms of the gods themselves. Magnificent and terrible, we are all bound there when our time ends."_

&mdash; From a lecture in the course "Introduction to The Planes", given by Senior Lecturer at the College of Gates in [Solaria](/gazetteer/solaria/).
