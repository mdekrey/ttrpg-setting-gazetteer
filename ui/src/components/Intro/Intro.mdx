# World Catalogue

Welcome to the World Catalogue, a comprehensive online resource for players
in Matt DeKrey's custom fantasy setting. Within you will find an overview of the
history and cultures of this realm, the diverse races that inhabit the land, the
gods that they worship, and the political intrigues that shape the fate of
nations.

Not all of the content contained within is common knowledge, but you will find
no secrets within; it is reasonable for your characters to know much of this
information.

This site will continue to be a work in progress, with constant updates and
expansions as the campaign progresses and evolves, filling in gaps where
necessary. If there is information missing that you want either clarified or
expanded upon, please let me know!
